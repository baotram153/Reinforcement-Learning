# Reinforcement-Learning

*"The road to wisdom? Well, it's plain* \
*and simple to express:* 

*Err* \
*and err* \
*and err again* \
*but less* \
*and less* \
*and less."*

â€“ Piet Hein

## Guide
- The `notes` directory contains my notes while reading the classic book *"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"* by Sutton & Barto. There are some concepts in the book that I still struggle with and haven't reached a clear understanding. If you want to have a discussion about anything RL-related, feel free to leave me an email :wink:
- The `notebooks` directories contains notebooks in which I try to reproduce some figures from the book.
- I'm still fixing and updating the notes so some images or formulas might not be rendered properly.

## To-do
- [ ] Modify the notes, add images
